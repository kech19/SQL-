# SQL PORTFOLIO

This portfolio showcases my SQL skills using diverse sets of datasets ranging from healthcare and business.

#### HOSPITAL PROJECT

The hospital project uses simulated patients data obtained from Synthea. 

I used SQL queries to analyze the data and returned the following:
* types of encounters
*	patients in certain type of encounters
*	number of patients with a particular condition
*	conditions with a certain number of occurrences
*	type of vaccines given to people with a particular condition
*	average payer coverage by race
*	total claim by zip code

I made extensive use of the following functions:
*	JOIN
*	INNER QUERIES
*	WINDOW FUNCTIONS
* AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
*	SET OPERATORS
